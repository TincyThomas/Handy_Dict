# Handy_Dict
Offline Dictionary with handful of general words.

importing json at start, because we have our dictionary's data in json format.
then, get_close_matches is function in Python imported from difflib to find close matches.
when a user enters a word, 

eg: if user types "Supermannn" with three 'n' at end 
   then this function will suggest - u meant "superman" ?
   if user responds with "Y" then meaning will get displayed.
   otherwise it will print "Fingers fallen on wrong letters, Type again."

FUTURE SCOPE:
This could be included in offline reader or devices where while if typing or reading, it happens user get confused with meanings then they can easily find meaning with the help of this, with no Internet.
